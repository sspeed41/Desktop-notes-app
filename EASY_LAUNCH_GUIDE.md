# 🏁 Easy Launch Guide - Racing Notes App

## ✅ **GUARANTEED WORKING SOLUTIONS**

### 🎯 **Solution 1: AppleScript App** (RECOMMENDED)
- **File**: `Racing Notes App.app` on your Desktop
- **How**: Simply **double-click** the app icon
- **Why it works**: Real macOS app created with AppleScript
- **Result**: Opens Terminal and launches your Racing Notes app

### 🚀 **Solution 2: Right-Click Method** (For .command files)
If you want to use the `🏁 Racing Notes.command` file:
1. **Right-click** the file on your Desktop
2. Choose **"Open With"** → **"Terminal"**
3. The first time, click **"Always Open With"** to set it as default

### 💡 **Solution 3: Terminal Method** (Always works)
1. Open Terminal (⌘ + Space, type "Terminal")
2. Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/scottspeed/Desktop/CursorDesktopNotesV1.0 && python3 run_app.py
   ```
3. Press Enter

## 🔧 **Why .command Files Don't Work**
- macOS sometimes doesn't associate `.command` files with Terminal
- Security settings can block execution
- File permissions may need adjustment

## 🎯 **Best Option**
**Just double-click `Racing Notes App.app` on your Desktop!**

This is a proper macOS application that will:
- Always work when double-clicked
- Open Terminal automatically
- Launch your Racing Notes app
- Show all startup messages
