# Racing Notes Desktop App - Version 2.5 Release Notes

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed: Notes with Tags Not Appearing in Recent Notes List

**Issue**: When creating notes with tags selected, the notes would fail to save to the database due to a UUID serialization error. This caused notes with tags to disappear and not show up in the recent notes list.

**Root Cause**: The `session_id` and `driver_id` UUID fields were not being converted to strings before being sent to the database, causing a "Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable" error.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed UUID serialization in `create_note_with_context` method
- Added proper string conversion for both `session_id` and `driver_id` fields
- Added connection checks to prevent null reference errors

**Files Modified**:
- `app/data/supabase_client.py` - Fixed UUID serialization and added connection validation

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Changes Made:
1. **UUID String Conversion**: 
   ```python
   # Convert session_id to string
   note_data["session_id"] = str(session_id)
   
   # Convert driver_id to string if it exists
   if note_data.get("driver_id"):
       note_data["driver_id"] = str(note_data["driver_id"])
   ```

2. **Connection Validation**: Added proper null checks to prevent client connection errors

### Impact:
- ✅ Notes with tags now save successfully to database
- ✅ Tagged notes appear in recent notes list
- ✅ Media attachments work correctly with tagged notes
- ✅ No more JSON serialization errors
- ✅ Improved application stability

## 📊 Verification

**Test Results**:
- Created note with 2 tags: ✅ Success
- Added media file: ✅ Success  
- Note appears in recent list: ✅ Success
