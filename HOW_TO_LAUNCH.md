## ⚠️ **App Bundle Troubleshooting**

### Desktop App Bundle Issue
- **Location**: `~/Desktop/Wise Desktop Note App.app`

  ```

1. **Security settings**: System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Allow apps from "App Store and identified developers"
2. **Right-click method**: Right-click the app → Open → Open (bypass security)
3. **Terminal method**: Run the launcher script directly (as shown above)
