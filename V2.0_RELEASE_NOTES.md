# Racing Notes V2.0 Release Notes

Welcome to Racing Notes V2.0! This is a massive upgrade that brings full cloud integration and a professional, Twitter/X-style video experience to your racing analysis workflow.

## üöÄ Key Features & Enhancements

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Full Cloud Storage Integration**
- **Supabase Storage**: All media files (videos, images, etc.) are now uploaded directly to your `racing-notes-media` Supabase storage bucket.
- **Cloud URLs**: The app now stores secure cloud URLs in the database, replacing local file paths. This means your notes and media are accessible from anywhere.
- **No More Local Storage**: Free up your local disk space! All media is now stored in the cloud.
- **Organized File Structure**: Files are automatically organized by type, year, and month in your Supabase bucket (e.g., `videos/2025/07/`).
- **Robust Uploading**: The system includes a fallback to local storage references if a cloud upload fails for any reason.

### üé¨ **Twitter/X-Style Inline Video Player**
- **Inline Playback**: Videos now play directly within the note card in your feed, just like on Twitter/X.
- **Click-to-Play/Pause**: Simple and intuitive video controls.
- **Mute/Unmute**: Videos start muted by default and include a mute/unmute button.
- **Hover Controls**: The video controls (play/pause, mute) appear on hover and fade out gracefully.
- **Modern UI**: A complete redesign of the media preview system for a more professional and intuitive user experience.

### üêõ **Major Bug Fixes**
- **Video Display**: Fixed the original issue where videos were not displaying in the feed.
- **Database Schema**: Corrected the database view (`note_view`) to use the `media_files` JSONB field, which was the root cause of the video problem.
- **UI Freezing**: Implemented progress feedback for uploads to address UI freezes when handling large files. The freezing is improved but still an area for future enhancement.

## üìà Technical Improvements
- **Async Operations**: Refactored the data service to handle uploads asynchronously, with progress reporting to the main UI.
- **Code Structure**: Introduced a `CloudStorageService` to cleanly separate cloud interaction logic.
- **Configuration**: Updated application name and version to `2.0.0`.

This release transforms Racing Notes from a local-only tool into a powerful, cloud-synced platform for serious racing analysis. Enjoy the new features!
